# Security Rules Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security rules that need to be implemented to improve the security posture of the Kanban board system.

## 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

### 1.1 Input Sanitization
- [ ] Implement input sanitization for all user inputs before storing in the database
- [ ] Use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content in descriptions and comments
- [ ] Sanitize all fields that will be rendered to the client to prevent XSS attacks

### 1.2 Enhanced Input Validation
- [ ] Add length limits for all text inputs
- [ ] Validate email format using proper regex
- [ ] Validate URLs if users can input them
- [ ] Implement content filtering for profanity or harmful content

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection

### 2.1 Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Strengthen the current CSP by removing `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in production
- [ ] Implement strict CSP with nonces or hashes for inline scripts
- [ ] Add `object-src: 'none'` and `media-src: 'self'` directives

### 2.2 Output Encoding
- [ ] Ensure all dynamic content is properly encoded before rendering
- [ ] Implement proper escaping for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and URL contexts

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

### 3.1 CSRF Token Validation
- [ ] Ensure all mutating API routes (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) validate CSRF tokens
- [ ] Add CSRF protection to file upload endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper double-submit cookie pattern as an alternative

## 4. Authentication Security

### 4.1 Password Security
- [ ] Implement stronger password complexity requirements (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- [ ] Add password strength indicator on the frontend
- [ ] Implement password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords
- [ ] Add support for password managers (avoid autocomplete restrictions)

### 4.2 Account Security
- [ ] Implement account lockout after 5-10 failed login attempts
- [ ] Add time-based lockout mechanism (e.g., lock for 30 minutes after failed attempts)
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Add account recovery mechanism with email verification

### 4.3 Session Security
- [ ] Set secure flag to true for cookies in production when using HTTPS
- [ ] Implement session timeout after a period of inactivity
- [ ] Add concurrent session limits
- [ ] Implement secure session destruction across all devices on logout
- [ ] Use SameSite=Strict for CSRF protection

## 5. Authorization and Access Control

### 5.1 Proper Access Control
- [ ] Implement fine-grained authorization checks for all routes
- [ ] Ensure users can only access their own data unless explicitly shared
- [ ] Implement Row Level Security (RLS) at the database level
- [ ] Verify all board member access controls are properly enforced

### 5.2 Resource Access Limits
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API requests per user
- [ ] Add quotas for resource creation (boards, cards, etc.)
- [ ] Implement soft-delete instead of hard-delete for critical data

## 6. API Security

### 6.1 Rate Limiting
- [ ] Add rate limiting to all API routes, not just authentication
- [ ] Implement different rate limits based on user role (admin, regular user)
- [ ] Add rate limiting based on IP address and authenticated user ID

### 6.2 API Security Headers
- [ ] Add security headers to all API responses
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policy with specific allowed origins
- [ ] Add API versioning to handle security updates

## 7. Data Protection

### 7.1 Data Encryption
- [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Add field-level encryption for PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- [ ] Use strong encryption for password reset tokens and other sensitive tokens

### 7.2 Data Privacy
- [ ] Implement data anonymization for analytics
- [ ] Add option for users to export their data
- [ ] Implement right to deletion compliance

## 8. File Upload Security

### 8.1 File Validation
- [ ] Implement strict file type validation beyond extension checking
- [ ] Add file content validation using file signature detection
- [ ] Implement virus scanning for uploaded files if possible
- [ ] Add file size limits with per-request limits

### 8.2 File Storage Security
- [ ] Store uploaded files outside the web root
- [ ] Use random filenames to prevent enumeration
- [ ] Implement access controls for uploaded files
- [ ] Add content disposition headers for downloaded files

## 9. Logging and Monitoring

### 9.1 Security Logging
- [ ] Log all authentication attempts (success and failure)
- [ ] Log authorization failures
- [ ] Log all data modification operations
- [ ] Log security-relevant configuration changes

### 9.2 Monitoring
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
- [ ] Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- [ ] Track file upload activities

## 10. Transport Security

### 10.1 HTTPS Enforcement
- [ ] Implement automatic HTTPS redirects
- [ ] Add HSTS header with appropriate max-age
- [ ] Ensure all resources are served over HTTPS

### 10.2 Secure Communication
- [ ] Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all communications
- [ ] Implement proper certificate pinning if applicable
- [ ] Secure database connections with TLS

## 11. Error Handling

### 11.1 Secure Error Messages
- [ ] Ensure detailed error messages are not exposed to users
- [ ] Log errors on the server side but return generic messages to clients
- [ ] Prevent error messages from revealing system information
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without revealing stack traces

## 12. Dependency Security

### 12.1 Dependency Management
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use `npm audit` or similar tools to check for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Use only trusted and maintained dependencies

## 13. Audit Trail

### 13.1 Comprehensive Logging
- [ ] Ensure all security-relevant events are logged
- [ ] Include user identity, timestamp, and action details in logs
- [ ] Protect logs from tampering and unauthorized access
- [ ] Implement log retention and archival policies

## 14. Additional Security Measures

### 14.1 Security Headers
- [ ] Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] Add X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
- [ ] Add Referrer-Policy: no-referrer or strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [ ] Add Permissions-Policy header to restrict browser features

### 14.2 JWT Implementation
- [ ] Consider implementing JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- [ ] Use proper JWT libraries with built-in security features
- [ ] Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Add token blacklisting for logout functionality

This security rules document should be used as a checklist for implementing security measures throughout the application. Each item should be implemented according to industry best practices and relevant security standards.
