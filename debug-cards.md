# Debug: Card Creation and Fetching Issues

## Problem
- `/api/lists/17/cards` returns 500 Internal Server Error
- `POST /api/cards` returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Cards cannot be created or fetched

## Quick Debug Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs
Look for specific error messages in Railway deployment logs around the time of the card operations.

### 2. Test Database Connection
```bash
# In Railway logs, look for:
# "✅ Banco de dados conectado com sucesso!"
# or 
# "❌ Erro ao conectar com o banco"
```

### 3. Test Specific Endpoints
```bash
# Test if list exists
curl -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" https://vercel-production-b07b.up.railway.app/api/debug/session

# Test simple card creation with minimal data
curl -X POST https://vercel-production-b07b.up.railway.app/api/cards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Card","listId":17}'
```

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Authentication Issue
The endpoints might be failing because session authentication is not working properly.

### 2. Database Connection Issue
The PostgreSQL database might be having connection issues on Railway.

### 3. Missing List
List ID 17 might not exist in the database.

### 4. Schema/Migration Issue
There might be a mismatch between the expected database schema and the actual schema.

## Immediate Fix Needed

Add authentication middleware to the card endpoints and improve error logging to identify the root cause.

The endpoints were modified to include:
- `isAuthenticated` middleware
- Detailed console.log statements
- Better error messages with actual error details

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code with better logging
2. Check Railway logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify authentication is working via `/api/debug/session`
4. Test with a simple card creation request
